# Authentication

 You will be issued a unique API key that allows you to access and authenticate your requests to the Zarpay API. This key is crucial for securing your API calls

ZarPay24 expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: your_api_key_here`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>your_api_key_here</code> with your personal API key.
